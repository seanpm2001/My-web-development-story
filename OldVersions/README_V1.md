## My web development story

This article goes over the web development experience of Sean Patrick Myrick from 2015 to 2023, January 12th.

### The beginning (2015-2018)

In the beginning, I was not very good at web development. I knew extremely basic amounts of HTML, only knowing how to change the page color and create `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags (I didn't even know the`<p>` tag yet) I also commonly looked for how to make hyperlinks, but never figured out how to embed an image in the first 3 years. I did some basic web development projects, but I mostly used online services.

### The spark (2018-2019)

In 2018, I was taking a Java class in High School. For some reason, I thought JavaScript and Java were extremely similar, and I created a huge demo file. It was a huge hunk of nothing. It was abandoned once I figured out the difference, but it provided lots of good notes.

In late 2018, I was experimenting with HTML, and I learned how to make a link that opens another HTML file. This was the spark that started it all. I began planning a web framework [SNU](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SNU/)

### The year of SNU (2019-2020)

In early 2019, I began to work on building the SNU website framework. I began experimenting, and used [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) extensively as a resource, [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) came second, and several other sites were used. The spark was still there, I began learning web development extensively, devoting 1-9 hours of time to the project per day. I had a testing environment (Firefox) and I built out the framework extensively. I began learning CSS (which I still maintain a mid-amateur level of knowledge) and JavaScript (which I still maintain just an amatuer level of knowledge)

In 2019 July, I began to try and learn PHP, but couldn't test my changes. I additionally tried Ruby. Work on the SNU framework continued. I gained knowledge of over 300 HTML tags, including ones that are now considered obscure, such as `<marquee>` and `<blink>`

### Going Git (2020-present)

I continued SNU development extensively on a daily basis up until 2020, May 25th, when I created my first GitHub account after learning what Git was. I loosened up on my private development, and made as much of SNU public as possible, along with other programming projects.

I didn't have a copy of the 60+ gigabyte SNU framework on my computer starting in 2021, and testing and web development significantly died down, although I still maintain lots of knowledge, and occassionally try to do web development.

I began developing GitHub Pages Sites in the summer of 2021, although not much HTML was used on these. I learned a bit about Jekyll, and throughout my time on GitHub, I became fluent in Markdown (although I still learn some things about it from time to time)

The level of testing has died down, but I have not given up. Nowadays, in 2023, I rarely use raw HTML, but know HTML embedding tricks in Markdown, and I am still learning more ways of doing that.
